# CheckersByMove
a java checkers game using stdin/stdout

Welcome to CheckersByMove!

This is a java program designed for standard input/output.

TO PLAY:
Moves are inputted using Portable Draughts Notation (PDE). Counting from the top left corner from the red side's perspective, from left to right then top down. Positions can be seperated by a "-" or a "x".

The AI is a brute-force algorithm that feeds garbage into the game until it accepts something. For your viewing pleasure this process has been removed from the output. The AI is incapable of stringing moves together for the sake of process time.
